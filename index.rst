Olive Python is `BD103's <https://github.com/BD103>`_ guide to creating Python packages.

Why Here?
---------

You're probably thinking something along the lines of:

  *Why this tutorial? Why not any other tutorial on the internet?*

Because BD103 has created a **lot** of Python packages.

* On `PyPI <https://pypi.org/user/BD103/>`_ he has over 6 different products
* On `Github <https://github.com/BD103?tab=repositories&language=python>`_ he has over 13 Python-based projects
* And on `Replit.com <https://replit.com/@BD103>`_ he has too many projects to count. *(Most of them are either unfinished, scuffed, or WIP but they still mean something!)*

Anyways, over the time he's been using Python he has picked up a few things. Eventually he thought:

  "Hey, it would be cool if I tought other people to do this as well!"

So that's the narrative. I hope you get something out of this guide, good luck!
